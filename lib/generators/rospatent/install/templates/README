# Rospatent Ruby - Rails Integration

The Rospatent Ruby gem has been configured for your Rails application.

## Configuration

You can find and modify the configuration in:
`config/initializers/rospatent.rb`

## Environment Variables

For security, it's recommended to use environment variables for sensitive information:

```
ROSPATENT_API_TOKEN=your_jwt_token
```

You can add these to your `.env` file if you're using the dotenv gem, or set them up in your deployment environment.

## Usage

You can now use the Rospatent API client in your Rails application:

```ruby
# In a controller or service
results = Rospatent.client.search(q: "search_term")
```

For more usage details, see the gem's README.md file.
